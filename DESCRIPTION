Description: Functions provide an improved FCM method (FCMm) for optical classification
    of inland waters remote sensing (Bi et al, 2019) <doi:10.1364/OE.27.034838>. Users can 
    train their own high dimensional spectra data to obtain the centroid via FCMm or just use 
    the built-in centroids for the inland water system. The package also supports the Chla 
    concentration estimation through published algorithms and finally to return the blending 
    results by assigning optimized algorithm results to specific water types. Spectra plot by
    the package 'ggplot2', application to image data by the package 'raster', and other practical
    remote sensing tools are also supported!

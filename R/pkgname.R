#' @title Fuzzy Cluster Method Based on the Optimized m Value (Fuzzifier)
#' 
#' @description 
#' \code{FCMm} is a package for fuzzy clustering water spectra (or called water color). 
#'   Given that the most of water color spectra data sets are considered as the high dimensional 
#'   set, the advantage of this method is making FCM assign the membership (sum as 1) harder, 
#'   ensuring the desired water type are restricted to its belongings (not too soft). It is 
#'   possible to cluster the harm algal bloom water type which can not be produced by FCM with \code{m=2}.
#' 
#' \itemize{
#'   \item If you want to cluster your own data sets, it provides an improved Fuzzy Cluster 
#'     Method (FCM) by optimizing the fuzzifier value (default but not good being 2). 
#'   \item You can also use the built-in cluster of inland waters produced by Bi et al. (2019) 
#'     and can simply obtain the Chlorophyll-a concentration by blending three algorithms with 
#'     relatively low bias.  
#'   \item It supports raster (or called imagery) processing (see more details in help documents 
#'     or vignettes).
#'   \item It includes several data sets about water color spectra and corresponding water quality 
#'     parameters and a testing image raster (see help documents for details).
#'   \item Please see NEWS to get changes in each version.

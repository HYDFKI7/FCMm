\title{Score a vector of error metrics for algorithms by the sort}
\usage{
Score_algorithms_sort(x, decreasing = TRUE, max.score = 100/4)

Score_algorithms_sort2(x, decreasing = TRUE, max.score = 100/4)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Input vector of error metrics (NA values are allowed)}

\item{decreasing}{the order of the good metric to be evaluated. For instance, MAE should use
\code{decreasing = TRUE} (Default) since the algorithm performs better when MAE becomes smaller. 
However, when comes to \code{Rsquare} from linear regression (maximum is 1), it should be
\code{FALSE}}

\item{max.score}{The max.score for \code{scales::rescale}. The default is \code{100/4}.}
}
\value{
Results of \code{Score_algorithms_sort()} are returned as a vector presenting score values.

Results of \code{Score_algorithms_sort()} and \code{Score_algorithms_sort2()} are 
  returned as a vector presenting score values.
